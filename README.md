Currency & Unit Converter Project:
It solves the problem of having to manually calculate common conversions by providing fast, accurate results through a Python script:)

What Problem It Solves:
Helps users quickly convert values such as:
Dollars -> Euros
Kilometers -> Meters
And more basic conversions

Main Features:
Very friendly
Supports multiple conversion types
Accurate mathematical operations

Who Its For:
Students learning Python or unit conversions
Anyone who needs quick basic conversions

Screenshots:

Installation:
Make sure you have Python installed.
Clone or download the project folder.
Run the converter using:
python converter.py
Download API using requirements.txt

Usage:
The program allows you to choose a conversion type (e.g., dollars → euros, km → meters).
Enter your value.
The program returns the converted result.
(You may add a video or GIF demo if you have one.)
Completed Functionality & Approximate Grades

Below are all features I completed and request grading for:
Try exept
Not in one file
Atomic commits
Read.me
Timed output
No chat gpt (find out how it works today xd)
Functions documentation
No more than 10 functions and 300 lines of code in a single file (use modules to store functions in a separate file
Love Trex
(I did almost everything that fits my code , didnt add databases and lambdas cause they will be useless in my project,understanding that material doesnt fit your project is valuable:)

Approximate Total: 90/100 points

Todolist:
Create lists of the values;
Add coefficients;
Create functions so the code can work;
Add loop with choices;
Get a huge mistake;
Spend a lot of time thinking of that mistake;
Correct it ;)
Add conditions and input values into the functions
Split code
Add timed output
Add try/exept


Incomplete / Planned Features:
I can add all currency in the world
